            <section>Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share knowledge and wisdom with the world—without having to build a mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right readers for whatever you have to say.</section>
